# Dispace setting

"Dispace" is a game setting,  a base for multiple different games taking place in the same universe.

## Universe

It's a parallel reality - doesn't have to accurately relate to human civilization.
Everything happens thousands years after Human and other Alien lifeforms were destroyed by a cataclysm.
The only conscious life are android-like robots, who assume they have evolved with the rest of the world.
They refer to themselves as '''Gens'''.

The story revolves around the Gens exploring the space and finding out what happened to the extinct Human Civilizational.
Even though its "space exploration", most of the action happens on the surface of the planets as the player visits them.

Each sub-game in the setting can be released as a septate game with a strategic idea
of incorporating them into a bigger one (Big Game).
The goal is to deliver something relatively simple and get the players feedback ASAP (< 0.5 year).
And depending on it use or not use the sub-game in the Big Game.

## Sub-games

Sub-games type may or may not have a muliplayer mode.

I gave them working names for a quick reference

    | name     |                              | player controls...            | mobile |
    | Prelude  | On-surface battle arena      | lander as a hired pilot       | -      |
    | Wanderer | Turn-based space exploration | space ship                    | +      |
    | Alman    | Story driven game            | lander descending from a ship | +/-    |

In the Big Game it would be a player, controlling spaceship, visiting different planets,
descending on the planets and actually controlling the lander, as well as taking part in
online battles "remotely" independent of where his ship is.

"Prelude" will become a built-in training program for the ship's crew.

"Alman" is a interim-state before the Big Game. I haven't yet defined it in details.

See GDD for each game as a separate document, starting from Dispace:Prelude
